# Backend
The backend is based on the following frameworks:

## Django
Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development 
and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of 
much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app 
without needing to reinvent the wheel. Itâ€™s free and open source.

You can find all documentations concerning django on the [official website](https://www.djangoproject.com/)

### Rest-framework
To build the api we use [django-rest-framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/)

#### JWT Tokens
The login to the api is done with [django-rest-framework-simplejwt](https://github.com/SimpleJWT/django-rest-framework-simplejwt)
