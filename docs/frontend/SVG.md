# SVG
Forge comes with a SVG sprite map generator and `<svg-icon />` component which requires only the name of the icon.
To add a new icon a new svg icon file needs be located in the `frontend/src/assets/icons/` directory. The name given to the file will be associated with the component. Eg. a 'menu.svg' can be used as `<svg-icon name="menu" />`
