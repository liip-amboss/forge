# Testing

So far we have the setup and knowledge to run unit tests. E2E tests as in
Nightwatch aren't set up yet.

The unit tests can be used to either test components or stuff like the store,
services etc.

## Setup

The tests really are setup automatically with vue cli, just check the boxes.

One thing to note: there's this neat little library called _rewire_, which
allows the importing of private (not exported) stuff from modules.
To use rewire, install `babel-plugin-rewire`, and add it to `babel.config.js` like so:

```js
module.exports = {
  // ..
  // presets and the usual blah
  // ..
  env: {
    test: {
      plugins: ['babel-plugin-rewire'],
    },
  },
};
```

## Running tests

In order to run tests, simply invoke `npm run test`.

All the tests in `tests/` are collected and run. To only run one test, you can
use the option `-d` and provide a search string.

## Coverage
Coverage is a measure of how much of our codebase is "covered" by tests. A coverage report is generated by jest.
The configuration for this is in `jest.config.js`

   ```js{4-21}
   module.exports = {
     preset: '@vue/cli-plugin-unit-jest/presets/typescript-and-babel',
     setupFiles: ['./tests/unit/setup.js'],
     collectCoverage: true,
     collectCoverageFrom: [
       '**/*.{vue,}',
       '!**/node_modules/**',
       '!**/styleguide/**',
       '!**/views/**',
     ],
     coverageReporters: [
       "clover",
       "json",
       "lcov",
       "text",
       "cobertura",
     ],
     reporters: [
       "default",
       "jest-junit",
     ],
   };
   ```

::: tip
coverageThreshold is set in gitlab-ci.yml to allow coverage to fail if it drops below MIN_COVERAGE_FRONTEND 
which is set in the project variables
```bash 
npm run test -- --coverageThreshold='{"global":{"statements":"$MIN_COVERAGE_FRONTEND"}}'
```
